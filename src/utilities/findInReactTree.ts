 * @description Traverses through a React node to find a specific item using a predicate, useful for searching children in node trees that might change as Discord gets updated.
 * @template T The type of the result you expect. Please keep in mind that the value might be null, wrapping your type in Nullable<T> is advised.
 * @param tree The React node to search through.
 * @param predicate Predicate function to decide whether the current item in the search stack should be returned.
 * @param options Search options for findInTree, see https://github.com/unbound-mod/client/blob/main/src/utilities/findInTree.ts for more information.
